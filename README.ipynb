    "\n",
    "The Black-DROPS algorithm is a model-based policy search algorithm (the ICML 2015 [tutorial](http://icml.cc/2015/tutorials/PolicySearch.pdf) on policy search methods for robotics is a good source for reading) with the following main properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the dynamics of the robot/system\n",
    "- takes into account the uncertainty of the dynamical model when searching for a policy\n",
    "- is data-efficient or sample-efficient; i.e., it requires very small *interaction time* with the system to find a working policy (e.g., around 16-20 seconds to learn a policy for the cart-pole swing up task)\n",
    "- when several cores are available, it can be faster than analytical approaches (e.g., [PILCO](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/))\n",
    "- it imposes no constraints on the type of the reward function (more specifically we have examples where the reward function is learned from data)\n",
    "- it imposes no constraints on the type of the policy representation (any parameterized policy can be used --- for example, dynamic movement primitives or neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better idea of how well Black-DROPS works please check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261). Here are the main figures of the paper for quick reference (the \"No var\" variants are variants of Black-DROPS without taking into account the uncertainty of the model):\n",

    "### What you should NOT expect from Black-DROPS\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NOT expect Black-DROPS to find very fast (in interaction time) high performing policies at every run: in the cart-pole swing up task, for example, the main trend (median) is that Black-DROPS finds a high performing policy after 16-20 seconds of interaction with the system, but it does fail sometimes completely to find any working policy after 15 episodes (60 seconds of interaction time); this also holds for analytical approaches like PILCO (see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261) for more details)\n",
    "- NOT expect Black-DROPS to find high performing policies very fast (in interaction time) when dealing with high dimensional state/action spaces (e.g., less than 8-10 episodes for a 15-D state/action space) or when dealing with difficult tasks (e.g. less than 20-25 episodes for the double cart-pole swing up task); the number of points needed to have a good model of the dynamics increases exponentially with the dimensions of the state/action space\n",
    "- NOT expect Black-DROPS to run fast (in computation time) in small computers; our results suggest that at least 8-12 cores are needed to get reasonable computation times for Black-DROPS (Black-DROPS heavily utilizes parallelization to improve its performance)\n",
