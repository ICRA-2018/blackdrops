### How to properly clone this repo

- Clone the repo *recursively*: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/resibots/blackdrops.git` (or `git clone --recursive git@github.com:resibots/blackdrops.git`)
- If you follow the [advanced installation](docs/advanced_installation.md), you do not necessarily need to clone recursively the repository.

### What you should expect from Black-DROPS

The Black-DROPS algorithm is a model-based policy search algorithm (the ICML 2015 [tutorial](http://icml.cc/2015/tutorials/PolicySearch.pdf) on policy search methods for robotics is a good source for reading) with the following main properties:

- uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the dynamics of the robot/system
- takes into account the uncertainty of the dynamical model when searching for a policy
- is data-efficient or sample-efficient; i.e., it requires very small *interaction time* with the system to find a working policy (e.g., around 16-20 seconds to learn a policy for the cart-pole swing up task)
- when several cores are available, it can be faster than analytical approaches (e.g., [PILCO](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/))
- it imposes no constraints on the type of the reward function (more specifically we have examples where the reward function is learned from data)
- it imposes no constraints on the type of the policy representation (any parameterized policy can be used --- for example, dynamic movement primitives or neural networks)

To get a better idea of how well Black-DROPS works please check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261). Here are the main figures of the paper for quick reference (the "No var" variants are variants of Black-DROPS without taking into account the uncertainty of the model):

### What you should NOT expect from Black-DROPS

In short, you should:

- NOT expect Black-DROPS to find very fast (in interaction time) high performing policies at every run: in the cart-pole swing up task, for example, the main trend (median) is that Black-DROPS finds a high performing policy after 16-20 seconds of interaction with the system, but it does fail sometimes completely to find any working policy after 15 episodes (60 seconds of interaction time); this also holds for analytical approaches like PILCO (see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261) for more details)
- NOT expect Black-DROPS to find high performing policies very fast (in interaction time) when dealing with high dimensional state/action spaces (e.g., less than 8-10 episodes for a 15-D state/action space) or when dealing with difficult tasks (e.g. less than 20-25 episodes for the double cart-pole swing up task); the number of points needed to have a good model of the dynamics increases exponentially with the dimensions of the state/action space
- NOT expect Black-DROPS to run fast (in computation time) in small computers; our results suggest that at least 8-12 cores are needed to get reasonable computation times for Black-DROPS (Black-DROPS heavily utilizes parallelization to improve its performance)

### Using the code

Please look at the [installation guide](docs/installation.md). You will find detailed guidelines on how to properly install all the dependencies, compile the Black-DROPS code and run scenarios. There is also an [advanced installation guide](docs/advanced_installation.md) which is recommended for users experienced with build systems and command line usage.

### Already implemented scenarios

Please look at the [implemented scenarios page](docs/implemented_scenarios.md). You will find a brief description of all the implemented scenarios and recommended parameters (e.g., number of maximum function evaluations for CMA-ES) for running them.

### How to create your own scenario

Please look at the [basic tutorial](docs/basic_tutorial.md). You will find detailed comments on how to create, compile and run your own scenarios.

### How to create your own DART-based scenario

Please look at the [DART scenarios tutorial](docs/dart_tutorial.md). Make sure that you have already read the [basic tutorial](docs/basic_tutorial.md), before proceeding to this one.


<!--### Python Code

We provide an implementation of Black-DROPS in python that is still in alpha version:

- The core of the algorithm is implemented
- Parallelization is not still working
- Further investigation needs to be done concerning the accuracy of the GP models-->
